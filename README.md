## Features

- Allows configurable switches for enabling or disabling features.
- Has a section for feedback data from the robot. Each log value is color coded with a bright background by the hash code of its name. So the colors for each log value will always be the same, and with practice you can find the value quickly.
- All values that end in a '!' are highlighted, because they're probably important.
- Mostly stable, checks for common problems.
